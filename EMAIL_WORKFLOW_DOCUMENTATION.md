# Email Notification Workflow for Dispatch Management

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive email notification workflow for the dispatch management system with automatic status updates and admin notifications.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Status Management
- **New Status States:**
  - Draft → Confirmed → **Out for Delivery** → **Delivered** → **Delivery Confirmed**
  - Color-coded status indicators in tree view
  - Status tracking with mail.thread integration

### 2. Automatic Email Notifications

#### When GRN is Uploaded:
- **Status Change:** Automatically changes to "Out for Delivery"
- **Email Trigger:** Sends notification to admin
- **Email Content:** Order details, customer info, logistics partner, E-Way Bill number
- **Action Required:** Admin needs to upload stamped GRN

#### When Stamped GRN is Uploaded:
- **Status Change:** Automatically changes to "Delivered"
- **Email Trigger:** Sends confirmation request to admin
- **Email Content:** Customer contact details, delivery location, confirmation instructions
- **Action Required:** Admin needs to confirm with customer and mark as confirmed

### 3. Manual Delivery Confirmation
- **Button:** "Confirm Delivery" (visible only when status is "Delivered")
- **Status Change:** Updates to "Delivery Confirmed"
- **Customer Confirmation:** Sets customer_confirmed = True
- **Notification:** Success message to user

### 4. New Fields Added
- `stamped_grn_attachment`: Binary field for stamped GRN upload
- `stamped_grn_filename`: Filename for stamped GRN
- Enhanced `state` field with tracking enabled

### 5. Email Configuration
- **System Parameter:** `dispatch.admin_email` (configurable)
- **Settings Integration:** Admin can set email in Settings → General Settings
- **Fallback Logic:** Uses admin user email or default if not configured
- **Mail Integration:** Full integration with Odoo mail system

## User Interface Enhancements

### Form View Updates:
- **Header Buttons:**
  - Auto Populate from Sales Order
  - Extract from GRN
  - **Confirm Delivery** (new)
- **Status Bar:** Shows complete workflow progression
- **New Section:** Stamped GRN upload field
- **Chatter Integration:** Activity tracking and message history

### Tree View Updates:
- **Color-coded Status:** Different colors for each status state
- **Status Column:** Enhanced with visual indicators

## Email Templates
